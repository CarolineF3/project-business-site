I love witches and witchy aesthetics so I decided to create a business site for a small witchy company. 

I planned my project by looking around Pinterest and Instagram for inspiration. I used "Image color picker" for picking out background colors.

If I had more time I would have put a lot more effort into the styling. I wanted to create a business site for Spellman Mortuary (from the Netflix show Chilling Adentures of Sabrina), but since I'm still a beginner (who gets stuck and has to google everything for hours) I opted for something easier. ðŸ¦‡
